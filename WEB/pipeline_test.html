                    <div class="text-sm font-mono text-slate-400 whitespace-pre-wrap">The case involves John Doe, a Senior Logistics Manager employed by Global Freight Solutions Ltd. for 3.5 years from June 2022, claiming unfair dismissal and breach of contract. On January 15, 2026, he was immediately made redundant without prior consultation, selection criteria, or an appeal process, citing 'digital transformation and restructuring.' His role was replaced by an automated system, but a new junior administrative role was created shortly after, which he was not offered. The Claimant argues the redundancy is a 'sham' to avoid performance procedures, alleging breaches of the Unfair Dismissals Acts 1977-2015 and lack of genuine redundancy under the Redundancy Payments Acts. The desired outcome is reinstatement or maximum compensation under Irish Employment Law.</div>

                    <div class="text-sm font-mono text-red-300/80 italic">As the adversarial opponent representing Global Freight Solutions Ltd., we assert that the redundancy of John Doe was a genuine and necessary action driven by legitimate business needs. The company's digital transformation and restructuring, initiated in early 2026, rendered the Senior Logistics Manager role obsolete due to automation, a valid redundancy reason under Irish law. The lack of prior consultation or appeal process was justified by the urgent operational requirements to remain competitive, and no legal mandate requires extensive procedures in such straightforward redundancy cases. The new junior administrative role, created as part of the restructuring, involves distinct skills and responsibilities not aligned with Mr. Doe's senior management experience, making him unsuitable for the position. Claims of unfair dismissal are baseless; the redundancy was not a 'sham' but a strategic decision, and any performance issues are irrelevant to this matter. Under the Redundancy Payments Acts, the employer complied by offering statutory redundancy, and reinstatement or excessive compensation is unwarranted.</div>

                <p class="text-xl italic font-serif text-white leading-relaxed">"As SUPREME JUDGE, based on the provided facts and Irish employment law principles, I find the dismissal unfair due to multiple procedural breaches and indications that the redundancy may not be genuine. Under the Unfair Dismissals Acts 1977-2015, the burden of proof rests with the employer to demonstrate fair procedures and a valid redundancy reason. Here, the respondent failed to conduct prior consultation, provide fair selection criteria, or establish an appeal process, which are essential under Irish law for ensuring fair procedures in redundancy. The creation of a new junior role shortly after the dismissal suggests the redundancy was pretextual, undermining the claim that the Senior Logistics Manager role was obsolete due to automation. Additionally, the obligation to consider alternative employment was not met, as the claimant was not offered the new role despite its existence. The respondent's defenses, such as urgent operational requirements, do not outweigh these procedural failures. Therefore, the dismissal is unfair, warranting compensation for the claimant."</p>
